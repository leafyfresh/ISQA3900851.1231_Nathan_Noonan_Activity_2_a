            Sadly Tobelerone is not my dog, but I am lucky enough to get to hang out with him sometimes. He is my friend
            Karl's dog.
            Toblerone and Karl are both somewhat mischeveous and they both appreciate a good snack.

            In this particular picture I was hanging out with people on the deck and Toblerone hopped up on my lap.
            He was was trying hard to get a bite of the cheese puffs I was snacking on.
