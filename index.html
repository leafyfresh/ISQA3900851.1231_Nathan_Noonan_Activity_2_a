            Hi Professor! I took your technical writing course when I was a senior at UNO long ago.
            I'm looking forward to this class and starting my Master's degree.
            Hopefully this is enough meaningful content. Would lorem ipsum text work for this kind of thing in the future or do you like the text to be somewhat thoughtful? 
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope you don't mind that I'm using bootstrap here.
            It was included on your example so I figured it was fair game.
            Also, I copied your .gitattributes file and .gitignore file, hope that's not a problem.
          </p>
