<h3>Note:</h3>
I originally coded this all at once and uploaded everything to https://github.com/leafyfresh/ISQA3900851.1231_Nathan_Noonan_Activity_2
When I read your grading metrics for this assignment, I realized you wanted this repository to have multiple commits with clean descriptions, hence this new repository.
